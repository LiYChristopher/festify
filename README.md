# spotifest
* The search function now shows a hover-dropdown menu where you can directly click the artist you want to add 
* Added CSS for the dropdown search menu (still to be optimized!)
* Worked on the flexboxes in the festival page. It should be easier to modify now. 
* The contributors now appear around the organizer. This is also to make place for an artist list on the left side.


* known issues: the join button moved because of CSS interference
* pressing enter doesn't work anymore to submit a name for a festival
